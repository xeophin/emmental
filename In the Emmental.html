During the year, you&#39;re usually too busy - it&#39;s quite a trip to his little home in the Emmental. But you took a few days off before Christmas, which gave you an opportunity to visit.

Snow covered the hills over the last few days, but now the wind has changed. The west wind drives shreds of clouds across the sky and sweeps the snow off the firs that now stand on the hills, black-grey.

It&#39;s getting dark, and you&#39;re on your way home. Of course, you could simply drive along [[the main road home]]. Or you could take the scenic route [[over the hills]].

A few farm houses between twisted apple trees.

A barn. A dog house.

The roof is so low that you can barely glimpse the sky.

Nothing moves. Or...

The woman who&#39;s been taking care of you is walking past the trees. She vanishes into the barn.

There&#39;s more people in the barn. At first, you think it&#39;s more relatives of the three women, but then you realise there&#39;s more to it.

They all look the same. Exactly the same.

This has to be another dream.

It definitely has to be a dream, because in the center of the barn, on a bed of straw, surrounded by identical women

An egg.

An egg of absurd size.

&lt;img src=&quot;pictures/ei.png&quot;&gt;

You can&#39;t imagine what kind of animal could lay such an egg. Its top is level with your hips. It&#39;s covered in brown smears.

The two women force you to your knees in front of the egg. Their grip never wavers.

And now you can see what&#39;s lying in front of the egg. A beheaded cockerel. And a dead cat. Your eyes stray to the cut in your arm. You&#39;re pretty sure you know now what the brown smears on the egg are.

«What is this? What are you doing?»

No one answers.

The egg starts to move.

A sound. A crack spreads along the egg. It widens. You can&#39;t look away.

The egg breaks open. Inside, covered with slime, barely moving, is a woman. She looks just like the others.

Her breath is fast and shallow. One of the women approaches her and hands her the dead bird. She accepts it with shaky hands.

She bites into it.

Rips the flesh from the bones, swallows. Devours it with what little strength she can muster.

And as she does, she becomes stronger. You can see it.

She gets up on all fours and moves towards the cat. Plunges her teeth into the body. Tears and chews. Bones break. Her face is smeared with blood.

She burps. She is much stronger now. But she doesn&#39;t have the strength she  needs yet. She gets up.

&lt;img src=&quot;pictures/modi_bluet.png&quot;&gt;

You hear their voices behind you. Away. Into the forest, where you can lose them.

(display: &quot;Flucht&quot;)

You hear dogs behind you.

&lt;img src=&quot;pictures/hund.png&quot;&gt;

[[And then you hear a voice.-&gt;Rettig]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Rettig" tags="" position="887,2411" size="100,100">She appears from behind a tree. One of the women.

She puts her finger to her lips.

It could be the one that took care of you, but you can&#39;t be sure.

She looks at you for a long time. Your coat is in her hands, but she makes no move to give it to you.

Then she makes a decision. She points out a direction.

«That way. To the village. Go. I&#39;ll distract them.»

Without another word, she turns and runs off, dragging the coat behind her.

So you run. Along the creek. Towards [[the village-&gt;Im Dorf]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Im Dorf" tags="" position="1203,2415" size="100,100">You&#39;re not sure how long you run. Then you see lights flickering between the trees. She told you the truth!

You make it to the village. A normal village. You find the biggest building. It&#39;s a pub called the Bear. Of course.

You stumble in and collapse on the floor.

«They all look identical! They&#39;re born from eggs! I barely escaped with my life!»

Hands pick you up, examine your wounds.

You keep telling them. You have to tell them.

People talk across one another.

You&#39;re brought to a bed. They give you tea.

«What can lay such an egg?»

You hear sirens. Good. The police will take care of it.

It&#39;s an ambulance. You&#39;re put on a gurney and carried in.

People try to calm you down.

«The police! I have to talk to the police! They&#39;re killing people!»

The people around you nod.

You&#39;re carried out of the ambulance again.

A new face.

«Don&#39;t you worry now. We&#39;re going to a quiet place where no one can harm you.»

But in a way, you&#39;re always happy when you&#39;re heading back into the city. As nice it is to see the hills again, those companions of childhood, you always have the feeling that something might crawl out of a shadowed ravine at any time.

You don&#39;t want to admit it to yourself, but you&#39;re relieved when you see that the main road has been cleared of snow, that there&#39;s no ice. There&#39;s little traffic and you make good progress. The west wind drives the clouds across the darkening sky.

Soon enough you&#39;re past Burdlef and on the motorway on-ramp, on your way home to the city.

Your dad was driving. Now you have your own car and with the west wind blowing, you have a sudden desire to see the hills. A little detour won&#39;t hurt.

You take a turn off the main road in the valley and enter a narrow little road that leads you into the forest. The road winds along the hill. After a sharp turn, you emerge from the forest. The detour was worth it.

The last rays of the sun touch the gently rolling snowy hills. They glow like gold. The snow next to the road glitters like a thousand little diamonds. The clouds are blood-red strokes on an infinitely deep blue sky.

For a moment, the west wind is gone. You hear nothing but the crunch of the snow under your feet. It&#39;s strange. You are so used to the city, cars always driving by, wherever you are. But here? If you don&#39;t move, it&#39;s absolutely quiet.

A shiver runs down your spine, and you&#39;re not sure if it&#39;s the cold or something else.

In the dark, it&#39;s harder to navigate these hills. You know that your satnav is useless here. You have to rely on yourself, on your childhood memories of sitting in the back of the car, looking out of the window as your dad drove you through the night.

A lot has changed since then. You feel like you&#39;re recalling a dream, and the more you grasp for your memories, the more they dissolve.

Here, this turn?

You know that you&#39;re in no state to resist. It&#39;s better to bear with whatever they&#39;re planning.

You have no idea what they&#39;re planning.

They lead you out of the door, out of the house, and along the path. It&#39;s even darker outside now. You really can&#39;t tell what time of day it is.

You make a half-hearted effort to break free, but it comes to naught. They march you to the barn.

With desperate strength, you twist out of your coat, roll across the straw, and [[run for the door-&gt;Flucht Real]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="41" name="Frontispice" tags="" position="600,50" size="100,100">&lt;h1&gt;In the Emmental&lt;/h1&gt;

You feel that you are plummeting into night-dark depths.

You can&#39;t tell up from down.

Your attempts to move unleash waves of pain.

You want to scream, to call for help

you can&#39;t make a sound.
